# CryptoClustering

I used w3 schools for some help with the k-clustering, and I referenced geeksforgeeks when creating my plots, but the vast majority (probably close to 90%) of my references were in-class assignments.

As a side note, I started this assignment a while ago, and then I came back to it, and at one point I had several word documents open with code snippets I had copied and pasted (my scatter plots were giving me a lot of grief this time around), 
so hopefully I haven't made any major errors or typos and everything runs smoothly now that I've "Frankensteined" everything together!
