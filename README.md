# CryptoClustering

I used w3 schools for some k-clustering guidance and geeksforgeeks as a refresher for my plots, but I used the in-class assignments for probably 90% of my references.
The scatter plots gave me some trouble there for a while, and at one point I had a bunch of word documents open with snippets of code that I had copied and pasted, so hopefully I haven't made any major typos or errors in my code and everything runs smoothly.
